This repository contains many examples of web components.  A few are
implementations of components published elsewhere.  But most are 
components developed to emulate all or part of the displays for the
Cologne Sanskrit Lexicon.

This document is a guide to the applications appearing in the various
subfolders.  The applications are listed in the order they were developed.

* [wc-blink](https://funderburkjim.github.io/webcompLearn/wc-blink/index.html) This uses only ES6 Javascript to create a very simple component.  It is
good to see this once.  But components that need attributes, properties,
and events require a lot more 'boilerplate' complexity.

* search-form :  This is a php application, so does not run on Github.
  It has nothing to do with web components.  It shows a php program with
  a 'search' entry, which references a 'database' of country names.
  As each character is typed, the display shows names whose spelling
  starts with the string thus-far entered.
